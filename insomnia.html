        <p>Sleep disorders can be a debilitating problem and up to one in three people in the UK are thought to have had insomnia at some point in their lives. Good quality sleep in absolutely essential to our health and well-being and without it can leave you feeling exhausted, anxious, irritable and lacking in motivation and energy and can also affect your ability to cope with life.</p>
        <p>The most common symptoms of insomnia are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Difficulty falling asleep</li>
            <li>Waking up during the night</li>
            <li>Waking up early in the morning</li>
            <li>Not feeling refreshed after sleep</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Stress and anxiety are usually major contributing factors when it comes to insomnia. Quite often individuals suffering from insomnia start to worry that they are not going to get a good night's sleep which can exacerbate the problem and thus it becomes a vicious circle.</p>
        <p>In contrast people suffering from depression quite often find themselves sleeping too much. During REM sleep your brain is working very hard and this is exhausting so you are encouraged to sleep more and more and so the vicious circle begins.</p>
        <p>Solution Focused Hypnotherapy is extremely effective in helping you resolve the underlying issues leading to sleep disorders and regulating your sleep patterns enabling you to enjoy a more fulfilling life without feeling tired.</p>
