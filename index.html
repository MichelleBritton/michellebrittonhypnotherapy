            <p>Solution Focused Clinical Hypnotherapy uses practical, modern and well researched techniques to help people move towards positive changes in their lives in a relatively short period of time. A combination of psychotherapy and hypnosis designed to encourage you to think about your preferred future rather than dwelling on problems of the past.</p>
            <p>Hypnosis is a safe, relaxing and pleasant experience and is considered the single most powerful psychotherapeutic tool for breaking the negative trance state of anxiety, anger and depression.</p>
