        <p>Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is an anxiety related disorder which causes individuals to have intense and persistent thoughts, producing negative emotions such as fear, worry or guilt, which together, can often drive them to carry out certain behaviours or rituals repetitively which can significantly disrupt their lives, their ability to work or sustain relationships.</p>
        <p>The obsessional thoughts are often intrusive, unwanted and disturbing. For example, it is common for new parents to have unwanted thoughts about harming the new baby, they become upset by the intrusion which in turn affects what they feel they must do to prevent harm. The compulsions are carried out in response to fears generated by obsessions and sufferers feel less anxious once they have been carried out and so the vicious circle of OCD develops.</p>
        <p>Although OCD can present itself in many ways, another classic example is an irrational fear of germs where an individual carries out compulsive hand washing.</p>
        <p>Most individuals with OCD know that their obsessions and compulsions are completely irrational but feel unable to stop. During the Initial Consultation I explain how the brain works and clients leave armed with a new understanding of how they can move forward.</p>
        <p>Solution Focused Hypnotherapy can help alleviate many symptoms of OCD by reducing stress and anxiety levels through relaxation techniques and by focusing, not on the obsession, but on how the client would like their future to be, effectively unlocking positive change.</p>
