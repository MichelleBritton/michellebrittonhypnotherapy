        <h2>What is Hypnotherapy?</h2>
        <p>Hypnotherapy is a combination of psychotherapy and hypnosis. The type of psychotherapy I practise is Solution Focused Therapy which in itself is very beneficial as it is designed to reduce anxiety and calm the mind by encouraging you to focus on solutions rather than concentrating on problems and promoting positive change, the effects of which are enhanced when used in conjunction with hypnosis.</p>
        <h2>What is Hypnosis?</h2>
        <p>Hypnosis is an altered state of awareness - a state of focused attention which is a pleasant and relaxing experience. This trance state is perfectly natural, we all enter this state several times a day. It is when we are in this trance state that we have access to the subconscious mind and the mind is more responsive to suggestion.</p>
        <p>Hypnosis itself reduces anxiety and the trance state is achieved through guided relaxation and visualisation techniques, allowing unwelcome thought patterns and habits to be resolved at a subconscious level.</p>
        <p>During hypnosis you will not be asleep, you will be fully conscious and aware of your surroundings and of what is being said to you, it's like daydreaming. You cannot be made to do anything you do not want to do â€“ you are in full control at all times during the session.</p>
        <h2>What to expect</h2>
        <p>Many people believe that hypnotherapy is like waving a magic wand and their problems simply disappear. Although hypnotherapy can produce amazing results it's not quite as simple as this!</p>
        <p>Solution Focused Hypnotherapy is a collaborative process and it is important to understand that full client commitment is essential and that change happens because you want it to and because you are prepared to take the necessary steps to allow it to happen.</p>
