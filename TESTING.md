### Known Bugs

No known bugs.

### Solved Bugs

- When resizing the browser the navigation would appear and slide off to the left.  Whilst the functionality was unaffected it did not make for a good user experience.  To solve this I created two navigations with different ID's and set the mobile navigation to display: none; for larger devices and vice versa for small devices.
- JavaScript was used to slide the navigation in from the left hand side but as there are two links in the navigation that are anchor links to sections within that page, when clicked on the navigation would not close. I added onclick="closeNav()" to those links to correct this.  closeNav() was a function provided in the JavaScript that I have found, credited below.
- Redirect code on form-submission.html.  I needed to redirect to the home page after 5 seconds.  The code I used was invalid but I realised I hadn't formatted the tag properly and the URL was wrong.
- Lighthouse indicated that there was a contrast issue.  The background was white and the text was black so I was puzzled as to how this could be a problem.  On further investigation, I realised that the mobile navigation, which was pushed off to the left, was somehow affecting this.  The navigation links are an off white and this is what was causing the contrast error.  I resolved this by adding some JavaScript to add a class of visible when the navigation was opened and to remove it when it was closed.  I added .visible to the CSS and set visibility to visible and add visbility: hidden to #mobile-nav.
